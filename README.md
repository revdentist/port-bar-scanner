# Basic Port Scanner

This is a simple Python script that scans the first 500 ports of a target host and prints the ports that are open. It uses Python’s socket library with a basic timeout.



python port_scanner.py

### Notes
- The target host in the script is set to `scanme.nmap.org`, which is the official Nmap testing server.
- The script checks ports 1 to 500.
- This is a beginner-friendly project created to understand how basic port scanning works.
